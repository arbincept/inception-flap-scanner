### Live UI Preview

![Inception Flap Scanner live feed](./docs/live-scanner.png)

This capture shows the public scanner feed with launch cards, bonding-curve progress and the staged security-audit signals. The feed is live and its contents change with on-chain activity.

## Demo & Concrete Example

Open the [live scanner](https://lucace-inception-flap-scanner.hf.space) to inspect the current launch feed without providing a private key. Select a token to view its bonding-curve telemetry, holder concentration and automated audit verdict, then use the embedded DexScreener view for additional market context.

Example workflow:

1. Open a newly indexed launch from the live feed.
2. Check the curve progress, liquidity, top-holder concentration and developer holding data.
3. Read the four audit signals before deciding whether further research is warranted.

The scanner is an informational, read-only tool; its signals are not investment advice and can be affected by RPC availability and changing on-chain data.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Real-Time On-Chain Launch Ingestion
- Listens directly to BNB Smart Chain block events and Flap.sh contract factory logs via high-speed RPC and WebSocket connections.
- Deduplicates incoming token launches and sorts them strictly in real-time chronological order.

### 2. Automated 4-Tier Security Auditor
Before interacting with any newly deployed token, the built-in deterministic auditor analyzes 4 vulnerability vectors:
1. **Tax & Bot Dust Filter (≤8% Threshold):** Automatically queries buy and sell tax rates. Serves as a primary mempool defense against high-frequency bot-driven dust launch spam and predatory honeypots, purging arbitrary or punitive fees from the radar stream (accounting for Flap's 1% platform fee, guaranteeing a total transaction tax under 9%).
2. **ERC-1167 Minimal Proxy Verification:** Decodes runtime bytecode against official Flap minimal proxy implementations (`0x363d3d373d3d3d363d73...5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3`). Instantly distinguishes standard factory clones from non-standard custom proxy contracts, detecting custom tokenomic innovations, experimental bonding curves, or unverified modifications.
3. **Social Clone & Phishing Detection:** Flags token impersonators, copycats, and duplicate social media handles (Twitter/X, Telegram) matching known projects.
4. **Dev Wallet Clustering & Funding Origin:** Classifies deployer funding wallets (CEX/bridge vs. fresh private addresses) and tracks serial deployer history.

### 3. Flap.sh Bonding Curve Telemetry
- Real-time bonding curve accumulation progress towards DEX migration (target: $12,000 liquidity / 100% curve fill).
- Tracks Market Cap (USD), Curve Liquidity (USD), Top 10 Holders concentration rate, and Developer Token Holding percentage.
- Embedded DexScreener chart viewer for real-time candlestick price action.

### 4. Non-Custodial Architecture & Zero-Secret Reliability
- Operates 100% non-custodial and read-only.
- Requires zero private keys, zero wallet credentials, and zero mandatory external API keys out-of-the-box.

## 🧪 Automated Testing Suite

The security auditor and telemetry engine are validated by an automated unit test suite:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Tax risk bounds and threshold boundary validation (≤8% safe vs >8% predatory)
- ERC-1167 minimal proxy bytecode matching and unverified proxy rejection
- Social media handle copycat detection and duplicate detection
- Developer wallet clustering and transaction volume classification
- Bonding curve percentage clamping and edge case calculations
- Mempool chronological descending order sorting
